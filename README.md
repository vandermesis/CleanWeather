## What is it
My first advanced project. Developed entirely with supervision of professional iOS developer. 

- used Clean Swift software architecture 
- followed coding best practices and SOLID principles
- with systematic code review
- all stages approved by my mentor
- all critical parts of application covered by unit tests with use of Bitrise CI
- alternatively - first scene is also made with MVVM design pattern (CityListMVVM folder)

Application shows current, past and future weather for different locations. 
It is completely rewritten Weatherly app.
